Sprint 3 reflection:
**In Sprint 3**, I learned a ton while building the **mini assistant feature**, especially about using **JavaScript** to create interactive and dynamic elements. Making it **draggable** and cycling through responses was a fun challenge that taught me more about **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**. I also focused on improving the design with **cool hover effects** and **smooth transitions**, which made the assistant look more polished. Overall, it was a great mix of **coding and creativity**, and I’m proud of what I built!

Blogs For MCQ wrong questions:

1. **Q3**:  
   I chose answer **A**, thinking that citizen science could involve everyone working in one location, but the explanation shows that distributed data collection across many locations is key to citizen science, which makes **C** the correct answer.

2. **Q10**:  
   I selected **A**, but the explanation states that the code doesn’t adjust positions correctly to align the circles horizontally. **B** is correct because it properly updates `xPos` while keeping `yPos` constant.

3. **Q11**:  
   I picked **C**, assuming the code accurately simulated the spinner, but the explanation highlights that the probabilities were incorrectly distributed. **D** is correct, as it ensures the spinner matches the intended proportions.

4. **Q12**:  
   I overestimated the growth rate by choosing **C**, but the explanation clarified that **B** is correct because it uses a consistent rate of increase based on the table for a realistic projection for year 12.

5. **Q13**:  
   I selected **A**, believing the app release didn’t affect message activity, but the explanation shows that message frequency increased after the app was introduced. **D** is correct as it reflects the shorter messages trend.

6. **Q22**:  
   I chose **D**, misunderstanding the comparison between hot days and total days. The explanation clarifies that **B** is correct, as it correctly checks if hot days are more than half of the total days.

7. **Q25**:  
   I assumed **D** could not be shortened, but the explanation demonstrates that repeated patterns like "HE" and "RE" allow encoding. **A** is correct as it is a string that cannot be further compressed.

8. **Q26**:  
   I chose **B**, but the explanation pointed out that the robot doesn't move from its position due to an incorrect condition. **C** is correct as it ensures the robot moves toward the gray square.

9. **Q28**:  
   I underestimated the bits needed by choosing **B**, but the explanation states that **D** is correct because 8 bits (\(2^8 = 256\)) are required to represent 200 unique characters.

10. **Q30**:  
    I selected **B**, incorrectly calculating the total time. The explanation confirms that **D** is correct, as the loop iterates through all genres, making the total time 5 hours.
    Here are reflections for the newly uploaded questions based on their question numbers and explanations provided:

11. **Q31**:  
   I chose **A**, thinking that only Program I correctly moves the robot, but the explanation shows that Program II also moves the robot correctly by using a loop that handles the grid logic. The correct answer is **C**.

12. **Q32**:  
   I selected **B**, assuming participants who read more were less likely to be interested, but the explanation clarifies that participants who read more were actually more likely to be interested in the application. The correct answer is **A**.

13. **Q33**:  
   I chose **B**, but I misunderstood how the flowchart logic worked. The explanation shows that **A** is correct because it matches the OR condition, where either one of the conditions being true sets `include` to true.

14. **Q44**:  
   I selected **D**, mistakenly believing all the given operations would result in an overflow error. The explanation clarified that only the operation **7 + 10** causes an overflow. The correct answer is **B**.

15. **Q45**:  
   I chose **A**, incorrectly representing a NAND gate. The explanation explains that **C** is correct because it accurately models a NAND gate, which outputs true unless both inputs are true.

16. **Q46**:  
   I selected **C**, thinking it was possible to solve the problem in unreasonable time, but the explanation confirms that it’s impossible to solve undecidable problems for all inputs. The correct answer is **D**.

17. **Q48**:  
   I selected **B**, but the explanation shows that this caused the experiment to simulate success for 25% of the time instead of 75%. The correct answer is **C**, which correctly represents the intended 75% success rate.

18. **Q52**:  
   I chose **B**, assuming only one sequence of steps worked, but the explanation clarifies that both options **I and III** work correctly for the algorithm. The correct answer is **D**.

19. **Q56**:  
   I selected **C**, assuming the program summed odd integers from 1 to 9, but the explanation clarified the program sums integers up to 19. The correct answer is **D**.

20. **Q62**:  
    I chose **B**, mistakenly thinking content would remain the same each time in an online encyclopedia. The explanation clarified that online encyclopedias are editable and constantly changing. The correct answers are **C** and **D**.
    Here’s the reflection for **Q66**:

21. **Q66**:  
    I chose **A**, but the explanation clarified that the list `[10, 20, 30, 40]` doesn't cause the procedure to fail because there are no values less than the first number, so the smallest value is correctly returned. The correct answers are **C** and **D**, as these lists reveal the flaw in the logic when a smaller value appears later in the list.
