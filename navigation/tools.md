8/30

I struggled during tools setup. A host of problems were caused due to the simple mistake of not activating Windows WSL.
Tools wouldn't show that they'd installed after I just installed them, such as Bundle, Ruby, and even Python.
However, after my CSA friend Srini helped me activate WSL, all my tools were working properly and my website launched flawlessly.

9/3

I changed the title of my "struggles" tab to "journey", so I may start logging my journey in AP CSP. I understood the "wire" framework
of the buttons Mr. Mortensen wanted us to design, and I also added a dancing "Mario" GIF to my website by saving it in my "images" tab as 
a sprite.
