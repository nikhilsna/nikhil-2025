I struggled during tools setup. A host of problems were caused due to the simple mistake of not activating Windows WSL.
Tools wouldn't show that they'd installed after I just installed them, such as Bundle, Ruby, and even Python.
However, after my CSA friend Srini helped me activate WSL, all my tools were working properly and my website launched flawlessly.
