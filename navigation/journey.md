Sprint 2 Journey & Reflection:

Hi, I’m Nikhil, and honestly, CSP has been a pretty great experience so far. **For the Blog and Big Ideas**, I came into the class feeling confident with Python, coming from a software Dad, but teaching my group's Lesson 3.8 on iteration, specifically with conditionals and lists took my understanding even deeper. Explaining how loops and conditionals work helped make the topic way clearer in my mind, teaching is twice understanding. Teaching it really tied into the big ideas we’re covering and my prep for the AP exam—especially with recursion and iteration, which are key for the Create Task and project-based learning (PBL).

**A standout memory** from this sprint was finally getting the hang of Git commands. Working in a SCRUM group and dealing with merge conflicts in GitHub was tough at first, but once I figured it out, it felt like a huge achievement.

**When it comes to Relevancy**, going over the basics like for-loops and conditionals during my lesson made me realize how important those fundamentals really are. A cool moment was when Trevor’s group covered the Fibonacci sequence—learning about recursion and problem-solving there tied directly to what College Board will test us on.

**Beyond Perfunctory**, this sprint really pushed me. I got better at technical stuff like HTML/CSS and GitHub, but teaching others helped me understand basics on a deeper level. Overall, this sprint felt positive, because I pulled all of my understanding together and built a much stronger understanding of the material.




Reflection:

How do I know my units?
I know my units because I was able to explain and teach key concepts like iteration as well as how to use it in tandem with lists and indexes. I also made sure to pose "what-if" scenarios to the class to deepen their knowledge of the subject material, which shows that I know my units.

How have I demonstrated an effort to retain this information?
I created a set of practice problems in a GitHub repository for the class, which I already worked on myself prior. I also reviewed them periodically to ensure I didn’t forget any key concepts and applied these when I was teaching the class, which are efforts that I made to retain the information.

How do I know this is my own work?
I worked independently on all the homework and submitted it on time while fulfilling all major requirements, which shows that this is my own work.

What memories do I have from my learning?
I remember spending extra time debugging researching online resources to help me learn topics more concisely from a variety of resources to deepen my knowledge of the source material, as well as debugging errors in my code whether it was a simple or a more conceptual error.

How did I make this work unique?
I customized my project’s interface with a sleek green design to compliment a "DNHS" nighthawks theme. This made my work and code "pop" which made it more unique.

Week 1

I struggled during tools setup. A host of problems were caused due to the simple mistake of not activating Windows WSL.
Tools wouldn't show that they'd installed after I just installed them, such as Bundle, Ruby, and even Python.
However, after my CSA friend Srini helped me activate WSL, all my tools were working properly and my website launched flawlessly.

Week 2

I changed the title of my "struggles" tab to "journey", so I may start logging my journey in AP CSP. I understood the "wire" framework
of the buttons Mr. Mortensen wanted us to design, and I also added a dancing "Mario" GIF to my website by saving it in my "images" tab as 
a sprite.

Week 3

I struggled to setup the virtual environment. This was because I was unaware that I had to setup a virtual environment usually upon every website open. After activating WSL, this worked flawlessly.

Week 4

I struggled once more with my makefile. This was due to Error 1, caused by not instaling build properly, as well as not staging commits. After saving files and committing them once prompted, and the error was resolved.
