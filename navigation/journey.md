Sprint 2 Journey & Reflection:

This sprint really helped me get a better grip on the bigger concepts and feel ready for things like the Create Task and project-based learning. By focusing on iteration and for loops, I was able to apply what I learned in ways that will definitely come in handy for future projects. I took some time to organize everything I’ve worked on, which gave me a clearer picture of how these ideas fit together. A moment that really stuck with me, and I hope shows how much effort I’ve put in, was when I tackled the more challenging parts of Lesson 3.8 on my own. I didn’t rely on outside help this time, and that felt like a big win for me. It was one of those times where I felt like I was really proving what I knew.
What hit me the most was learning how to use loops and conditions with lists in a smarter way. I didn’t realize how powerful those tools could be until I worked through the lessons, and that changed how I think about solving problems.
This sprint gave me personal growth. I now have more confidence in my coding skills, especially when it comes to using loops and lists, and I know I’ll be able to build on that for the challenges ahead.

Reflection:

How do I know my units?
I know my units because I was able to explain and teach key concepts like iteration as well as how to use it in tandem with lists and indexes. I also made sure to pose "what-if" scenarios to the class to deepen their knowledge of the subject material, which shows that I know my units.

How have I demonstrated an effort to retain this information?
I created a set of practice problems in a GitHub repository for the class, which I already worked on myself prior. I also reviewed them periodically to ensure I didn’t forget any key concepts and applied these when I was teaching the class, which are efforts that I made to retain the information.

How do I know this is my own work?
I worked independently on all the homework and submitted it on time while fulfilling all major requirements, which shows that this is my own work.

What memories do I have from my learning?
I remember spending extra time debugging researching online resources to help me learn topics more concisely from a variety of resources to deepen my knowledge of the source material, as well as debugging errors in my code whether it was a simple or a more conceptual error.

How did I make this work unique?
I customized my project’s interface with a sleek green design to compliment a "DNHS" nighthawks theme. This made my work and code "pop" which made it more unique.

Week 1

I struggled during tools setup. A host of problems were caused due to the simple mistake of not activating Windows WSL.
Tools wouldn't show that they'd installed after I just installed them, such as Bundle, Ruby, and even Python.
However, after my CSA friend Srini helped me activate WSL, all my tools were working properly and my website launched flawlessly.

Week 2

I changed the title of my "struggles" tab to "journey", so I may start logging my journey in AP CSP. I understood the "wire" framework
of the buttons Mr. Mortensen wanted us to design, and I also added a dancing "Mario" GIF to my website by saving it in my "images" tab as 
a sprite.

Week 3

I struggled to setup the virtual environment. This was because I was unaware that I had to setup a virtual environment usually upon every website open. After activating WSL, this worked flawlessly.

Week 4

I struggled once more with my makefile. This was due to Error 1, caused by not instaling build properly, as well as not staging commits. After saving files and committing them once prompted, and the error was resolved.
