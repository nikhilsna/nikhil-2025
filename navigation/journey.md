Sprint 2 Journey & Reflection:

Hi, I'm Nikhil, and my reflection about CSP has overall been positive. When I came into this classroom, I felt confident in my Python skills, however not so confident in my skills interacting with a text-based operating system such as Linux. However, I ended up learning much more than I would've thought, such as web development, specifically my own lesson 3.8 iteration. I strongly believe that teaching is twice of understanding, which helped me understand the fundamentals which skyrocketed my overall understanding as well as learning new things like HTML/CSS, working in a SCRUM group and using Github and VsCode.

This sprint really helped me prepare for the Create Task and project-based learning in CSP. Focusing on Lesson 3.8, specifically iteration, for loops, and lists, gave me a chance to improve where I needed it most. I have a personal coding background, and while I thought I understood these concepts, diving deeper showed me how much more there is to learn. Teaching these ideas to others made me realize that explaining something is twice the understanding. It really forced me to think through the fundamentals that I might’ve skimmed over before.

Big Idea 3, which covers algorithms and programming, is something the College Board will be testing me on. These lessons pushed me to get comfortable with the kind of iteration and conditional logic I’ll need for both the exam and my own projects. Working through these exercises and then teaching them helped reinforce what I was learning in a way that just studying alone couldn’t. I feel like this approach really solidified the core concepts and gave me a better understanding of how to apply them.

Reflection:

How do I know my units?
I know my units because I was able to explain and teach key concepts like iteration as well as how to use it in tandem with lists and indexes. I also made sure to pose "what-if" scenarios to the class to deepen their knowledge of the subject material, which shows that I know my units.

How have I demonstrated an effort to retain this information?
I created a set of practice problems in a GitHub repository for the class, which I already worked on myself prior. I also reviewed them periodically to ensure I didn’t forget any key concepts and applied these when I was teaching the class, which are efforts that I made to retain the information.

How do I know this is my own work?
I worked independently on all the homework and submitted it on time while fulfilling all major requirements, which shows that this is my own work.

What memories do I have from my learning?
I remember spending extra time debugging researching online resources to help me learn topics more concisely from a variety of resources to deepen my knowledge of the source material, as well as debugging errors in my code whether it was a simple or a more conceptual error.

How did I make this work unique?
I customized my project’s interface with a sleek green design to compliment a "DNHS" nighthawks theme. This made my work and code "pop" which made it more unique.

Week 1

I struggled during tools setup. A host of problems were caused due to the simple mistake of not activating Windows WSL.
Tools wouldn't show that they'd installed after I just installed them, such as Bundle, Ruby, and even Python.
However, after my CSA friend Srini helped me activate WSL, all my tools were working properly and my website launched flawlessly.

Week 2

I changed the title of my "struggles" tab to "journey", so I may start logging my journey in AP CSP. I understood the "wire" framework
of the buttons Mr. Mortensen wanted us to design, and I also added a dancing "Mario" GIF to my website by saving it in my "images" tab as 
a sprite.

Week 3

I struggled to setup the virtual environment. This was because I was unaware that I had to setup a virtual environment usually upon every website open. After activating WSL, this worked flawlessly.

Week 4

I struggled once more with my makefile. This was due to Error 1, caused by not instaling build properly, as well as not staging commits. After saving files and committing them once prompted, and the error was resolved.
