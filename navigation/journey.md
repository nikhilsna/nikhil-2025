Sprint 2 Journey & Reflection:

Hi, I'm Nikhil, and my experience about CSP has overall been positive. When I came into this classroom, I felt confident in my Python skills, however not so confident in my skills interacting with Linux. However, I ended up learning much more than I would've thought,  specifically from my own taught lesson 3.8 iteration with lists. An example of code which I made for my lesson was looping through an index with conditionals. I strongly believe that teaching is twice of understanding, which helped me understand the fundamentals which improved my overall understanding as well as learning new things like HTML/CSS, working in a SCRUM group and using Github and VsCode, all of which taught me to work more efficiently. 

This sprint really helped me prepare for the Create Task and project-based learning in CSP, as well as he college board exam. Focusing on Lesson 3.8, specifically iteration, for loops, and lists, gave me a chance to improve where I needed it most. I have a personal coding background, and while I thought I understood these concepts, diving deeper showed me how much more there is to learn, and how valuable learning the basics are which is the msot memorable learnign experience from big Idea 3 for me, which allows me to understand basic tools like lists far better. Understanding the fundamentals instead of skimming them was my most memorable experience from Sprint 2. The most interesting lesson by far was Trevors group, specifically covering the Fibonacci sequence which mentioned our topic of recursion to solve real problems.



Reflection:

How do I know my units?
I know my units because I was able to explain and teach key concepts like iteration as well as how to use it in tandem with lists and indexes. I also made sure to pose "what-if" scenarios to the class to deepen their knowledge of the subject material, which shows that I know my units.

How have I demonstrated an effort to retain this information?
I created a set of practice problems in a GitHub repository for the class, which I already worked on myself prior. I also reviewed them periodically to ensure I didn’t forget any key concepts and applied these when I was teaching the class, which are efforts that I made to retain the information.

How do I know this is my own work?
I worked independently on all the homework and submitted it on time while fulfilling all major requirements, which shows that this is my own work.

What memories do I have from my learning?
I remember spending extra time debugging researching online resources to help me learn topics more concisely from a variety of resources to deepen my knowledge of the source material, as well as debugging errors in my code whether it was a simple or a more conceptual error.

How did I make this work unique?
I customized my project’s interface with a sleek green design to compliment a "DNHS" nighthawks theme. This made my work and code "pop" which made it more unique.

Week 1

I struggled during tools setup. A host of problems were caused due to the simple mistake of not activating Windows WSL.
Tools wouldn't show that they'd installed after I just installed them, such as Bundle, Ruby, and even Python.
However, after my CSA friend Srini helped me activate WSL, all my tools were working properly and my website launched flawlessly.

Week 2

I changed the title of my "struggles" tab to "journey", so I may start logging my journey in AP CSP. I understood the "wire" framework
of the buttons Mr. Mortensen wanted us to design, and I also added a dancing "Mario" GIF to my website by saving it in my "images" tab as 
a sprite.

Week 3

I struggled to setup the virtual environment. This was because I was unaware that I had to setup a virtual environment usually upon every website open. After activating WSL, this worked flawlessly.

Week 4

I struggled once more with my makefile. This was due to Error 1, caused by not instaling build properly, as well as not staging commits. After saving files and committing them once prompted, and the error was resolved.
