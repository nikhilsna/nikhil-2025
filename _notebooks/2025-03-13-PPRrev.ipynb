    "# Blog 1: Past Game Feature Overview and Meeting CPT Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Past Game Feature Overview (PPR)\n",
    "\n",
    "![pastGame Table Structure]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pastGametable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### User and Login-Centric Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Past Game** feature is designed with a strong emphasis on user experience and security. It's tailored to provide users with an intuitive interface to manage their chess game history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Authentication**: Ensures that only authenticated users can access and manipulate their game data.\n",
    "- **Personalized Experience**: Users can view, add, update, and delete their past game records, giving them full control over their data.\n",
    "- **Secure Data Handling**: Implements secure communication protocols to protect user information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Past Game Feature Meets CPT Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input and Output from User's Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**:\n",
    "  - Users input game details such as winner, ELO rating, and unique game ID.\n",
    "  - Inputs are provided via a secure, authenticated web interface.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - Users receive confirmation messages upon successful operations.\n",
    "  - The system displays updated game history reflecting recent changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CPT Language and FRQ Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "In developing the **Past Game** feature, I incorporated key programming concepts required by the College Board's Create Performance Task (CPT). Below are code snippets from my feature that demonstrate these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Procedures**: Developed functions that include sequencing, selection, and iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequencing**: The order in which statements are executed in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection**: Making decisions based on conditions (e.g., `if` statements).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration**: Repeating a sequence of statements (e.g., loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Snippet Demonstrating Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to update a past game record (models.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "def update(self, winner=\"\", elo=0):\n",
    "    # Sequencing: steps executed in logical order\n",
    "    if len(winner) > 0: \n",
    "        # Selection: condition to check if winner is provided\n",
    "        self.winner = winner\n",
    "    if elo > 0:\n",
    "        # Selection: condition to check if ELO is provided\n",
    "        self.elo = elo\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Attempt to commit changes to the database\n",
    "        db.session.commit()\n",
    "        return self\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        # Handle exceptions and rollback\n",
    "        db.session.rollback()\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequencing**: The code executes statements in a specific order to perform the update.\n",
    "- **Selection**: The `if` statements decide whether to update certain fields based on provided input.\n",
    "- **Iteration**: While not explicitly shown here, iteration is used when processing multiple records.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Parameters and Return Values**: Functions are designed with clear inputs and outputs to enhance modularity and reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Snippet Demonstrating Parameters and Return Values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to create a new past game record (models.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "def create(self):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Add the new game to the session\n",
    "        db.session.add(self)\n",
    "        # Commit the session to save the game\n",
    "        db.session.commit()\n",
    "        return self  # Return the created game object\n",
    "    except IntegrityError:\n",
    "        # Handle integrity errors (e.g., unique constraints)\n",
    "        db.session.rollback()\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: The method operates on `self`, which contains attributes like `winner`, `elo`, and `uid`.\n",
    "- **Return Values**: Returns the `self` object upon successful creation, or `None` if an error occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Calling Procedures**: Demonstrating how procedures are invoked within the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Snippet Showing Procedure Calls:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# API endpoint to create a new past game (routes.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/pastgame/create', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def create_past_game():\n",
    "    data = request.get_json()\n",
    "    # Create a new instance of pastGame\n",
    "    new_game = pastGame(\n",
    "        uid=data['uid'],\n",
    "        winner=data['winner'],\n",
    "        elo=data['elo'],\n",
    "        user_id=current_user.id\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    # Call the create method\n",
    "    created_game = new_game.create()\n",
    "    if created_game:\n",
    "        return jsonify(created_game.read()), 201\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Game could not be created\"}), 400\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Procedure Call**: `new_game.create()` invokes the `create` method to save the game.\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Data from the user is passed to initialize the `pastGame` object.\n",
    "- **Return Value**: The result of `create()` is used to determine the response.\n",
