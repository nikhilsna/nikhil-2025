    "\n",
    "### CPT Language and FRQ Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "In developing the **Past Game** feature, I incorporated key programming concepts required by the College Board's Create Performance Task (CPT). Below are code snippets from my feature that demonstrate these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Procedures**: Developed functions that include sequencing, selection, and iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequencing**: The order in which statements are executed in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection**: Making decisions based on conditions (e.g., `if` statements).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration**: Repeating a sequence of statements (e.g., loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Snippet Demonstrating Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to update a past game record (models.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "def update(self, winner=\"\", elo=0):\n",
    "    # Sequencing: steps executed in logical order\n",
    "    if len(winner) > 0: \n",
    "        # Selection: condition to check if winner is provided\n",
    "        self.winner = winner\n",
    "    if elo > 0:\n",
    "        # Selection: condition to check if ELO is provided\n",
    "        self.elo = elo\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Attempt to commit changes to the database\n",
    "        db.session.commit()\n",
    "        return self\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        # Handle exceptions and rollback\n",
    "        db.session.rollback()\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequencing**: The code executes statements in a specific order to perform the update.\n",
    "- **Selection**: The `if` statements decide whether to update certain fields based on provided input.\n",
    "- **Iteration**: While not explicitly shown here, iteration is used when processing multiple records.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Parameters and Return Values**: Functions are designed with clear inputs and outputs to enhance modularity and reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Snippet Demonstrating Parameters and Return Values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        db.session.rollback()\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: The method operates on `self`, which contains attributes like `winner`, `elo`, and `uid`.\n",
    "- **Return Values**: Returns the `self` object upon successful creation, or `None` if an error occurs. \n",

    "## Challenges and Areas for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "No learning journey is without its challenges. Recognizing these obstacles is the first step toward personal and professional growth. Here are the areas I aim to improve:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Management in Large-Scale Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Underestimation of Time for Debugging and Testing**: Throughout the development process, I occasionally underestimated the time required for thorough debugging and comprehensive testing. This oversight sometimes led to last-minute fixes and added pressure close to deadlines.\n",
    "- **Future Strategies**:\n",
    "  - **Structured Sprints**: Implementing structured sprints will allow me to allocate specific time frames for different development stages, including ample time for testing and debugging.\n",
    "  - **Burndown Charts**: Maintaining a burndown chart will help track progress against time, ensuring that I stay on schedule and identify potential bottlenecks early in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developing a Developer's Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Challenges with Tools and Workflows**: Adapting to the mindset of a developer involves more than just coding; it requires mastering the tools and workflows that facilitate collaboration and efficient development.\n",
    "- **Struggles with GitHub**:\n",
    "  - **Cloning and Sharing**: Initially found it challenging to manage repositories, clone projects, and share code effectively using GitHub.\n",
    "  - **Version Control**: Faced difficulties in understanding branch management and the nuances of commit histories.\n",
    "- **Navigating VSCode Operations**:\n",
    "  - **Merge Conflicts**: Encountered obstacles when working with the merge editor, often leading to merge conflicts that were time-consuming to resolve.\n",
    "  - **Optimizing Workflow**: Needed to learn how to utilize extensions and features in VSCode to enhance productivity.\n",
    "- **Implementing CPT Requirements**:\n",
    "  - **Interpreting Guidelines**: Struggled to interpret and implement the College Board's CPT requirements accurately within my project.\n",
    "  - **Documentation and Standards**: Found it challenging to adhere to coding standards and properly document code according to CPT expectations.\n",
    "- **Future Strategies**:\n",
    "  - **Continuous Learning**: Commit to ongoing education through tutorials, workshops, and collaboration with more experienced developers to enhance my proficiency with development tools.\n",
    "  - **Practice and Application**: Regularly apply GitHub and VSCode in small projects to build confidence and familiarity.\n",
    "  - **Seeking Feedback**: Engage with peers and mentors to receive constructive feedback on implementing CPT requirements and improving coding practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "These mindset adjustments, particularly embracing the realization that \"nobody's here to spoon-feed you instructions,\" allowed me to become more adept with JavaScript and agile methodology, while also deepening my interest in computer science as a whole. This shift pushed me to independently refine skills such as debugging, version control (GitHub), efficient use of VSCode, and interpreting complex requirements—skills that proved invaluable during the development of my past game project.\n",

    "**C.** There is a statistically significant negative correlation (p < 0.01) between pH and prediction accuracy, with the algorithm performing worse at lower pH values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**D.** The algorithm's predictions fall within the acceptable deviation threshold for 60% of the proteins tested, with the most significant deviations occurring in proteins with extreme combinations of size and temperature parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer:**\n",
    "The correct answer is **D**, because examining the data shows that 3 out of 5 proteins (PRO-A742, PRO-C588, and PRO-E871) have deviations within the ±0.08 threshold, which equals 60%. The two proteins with deviations exceeding the threshold (PRO-B219 at -0.11 and PRO-D105 at -0.09) are indeed the ones with the most extreme combinations of size and temperature - PRO-B219 has a high temperature (42.5°C) combined with large size (327 amino acids), while PRO-D105 has the largest size (412 amino acids) combined with the lowest temperature (36.0°C).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrong Answer Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A wrong answer I might have selected is **A**: The algorithm systematically overestimates the stability of larger proteins (>300 amino acids) and underestimates smaller proteins, suggesting a fundamental flaw in the sequence analysis component.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I might have thought it was correct:**\n",
    "- I noticed that the two largest proteins (PRO-B219 and PRO-D105) both have negative deviations, meaning the algorithm overestimated their stability.\n",
    "- Conversely, I observed that smaller proteins like PRO-A742, PRO-C588, and PRO-E871 all have positive deviations, suggesting the algorithm underestimated their stability.\n",
    "- This pattern seems to indicate a systematic bias related to protein size, which would be a fundamental issue in the algorithm.\n",
    "- However, I failed to carefully analyze whether this pattern is consistent enough to be considered \"systematic\" and didn't consider that other factors might be contributing to these deviations more significantly than protein size alone.\n",
    "- I also didn't properly consider that correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation in this complex multivariate system of protein folding.\n",
