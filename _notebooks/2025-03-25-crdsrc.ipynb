    "\n",
    "1. **Crowdfunding**: Collects small contributions from many people to fund projects, making innovation more accessible.  \n",
    "2. **Crowd Creation**: Gathers creative input, like Wikipediaâ€™s community-driven content creation.  \n",
    "3. **Crowd Voting**: Uses public feedback to guide decisions, such as voting systems on Reddit.  \n",
    "4. **Crowd Wisdom**: Leverages collective intelligence for problem-solving, like prediction markets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each type allows diverse groups to collaborate, leading to new ideas and solutions.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Crowdsourcing has transformed innovation by unlocking the collective power of diverse groups. It enables funding through crowdfunding, creative input through crowd creation, and problem-solving through crowd wisdom. Distributed computing enhances these efforts by dividing complex tasks among many computers, while data crowdsourcing fuels open-source projects with valuable datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, crowdsourcing will continue to drive innovation, connecting people globally to solve challenges and create new possibilities."
