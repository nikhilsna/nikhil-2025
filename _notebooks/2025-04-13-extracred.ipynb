    "Based on today's panel, I have learned and understood how cybersecurity is extremely important, and can help save a business from being killed. I hope one day to create my own business in video game development, and after today's panel, it has shown me that cybersecurity is something extremely important you need to make sure to strengthen and have when creating a business, to avoid hacking and data breaches. I would like to dive further into learning about cybersecurity and the benefits of having a strong form of it. It is important I learn more about this, so when I do create a business one day, I can also spend time working in the cybersecurity to make sure the integrity is at the utmost importance. I am very glad I took the time to understand the importance of cybersecurity and why we need it."
